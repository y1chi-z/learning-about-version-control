# Learning about Version Control
Author: Essie Zhang

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

One thing that I like the most about version control is that it keeps tracking the history of the project. If we accidentally deleted a file locally, we can retrieve from the remote repository without losing all the works.

One thing that I find most challenging about version control is resolving merge conflicts in a large collaborative project including many team members. We will have to ensure that everyone's work is correctly merged to the main branch by checking the code and solving the problem line by line.
